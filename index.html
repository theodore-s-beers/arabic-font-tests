            <em>
              I first put together a version of this in fall 2019, wasn’t really
              happy with it, and didn’t share it. I came back to it in early
              2021 and made some revisions, and I think it might be useful.
              Without further ado…
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve been poking around for good general-purpose, Arabic-script web
            fonts to use for a few projects. One obvious place to look is Google
            Fonts. So I went to
            <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >their site</a
            >
            and selected Arabic. Ok, wow… that narrows things down from 1,000+
            fonts
            <a
              href="https://fonts.google.com/?subset=arabic"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >to 21</a
            >. It shouldn’t be too difficult to determine which of those might
            work for my purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            And what are my purposes/requirements? Again, I’m looking for a
            general-use font, which would be suitable for entire paragraphs of
            text. Anything overly stylized or clearly intended for “display” is
            not going to work. With this criterion, I can eliminate the
            following 11 options at the outset: Almarai, Cairo, Changa, El
            Messiri, Jomhuria, Kufam, Lalezar, Lemonada, Rakkas, Reem Kufi, and
            Vibes (wtf?). Some of these are quite attractive typefaces in their
            own way—I would highlight El Messiri, Lalezar, and Reem Kufi—but
            they don’t fit my current use case.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we’re already down to ten. A few more can be cut for particular
            reasons. Mada doesn’t look quite right to me. The letters join with
            little gaps (intentionally), which are reminiscent of a rendering
            problem. Harmattan was designed for West African languages, and thus
            fills an important niche. Finally, there’s Katibeh, which has
            certain embellishments&#8202;—&#8202;referred to in
            <a
              href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Katibeh"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >the description</a
            >
            as “small serif-like outstrokes”&#8202;—&#8202;which seem to me to
            create an unwelcome distraction. As always,
            <em>de gustibus non est disputandum</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This leaves us with seven options. Two of them, Aref Ruqaa and
            Tajawal, could have been excluded on stylistic grounds. But I wanted
            to give a chance to a couple of less conventional fonts, and these
            look nice to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our seven finalists are as follows (in alphabetical order):

              >Tajawal</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let’s introduce some further desiderata. I need a font that
            works in both Arabic and Persian. (This usually is not a problem.
            Persian has a few extra letters that are close variants of Arabic
            forms.) Light to moderate use of
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_diacritics"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >diacritics</a
            >
            should not break anything. (This often <em>is</em> a problem.) And
            I’m looking for versatility and readability. The typeface should be
            elegant, without drawing too much attention, across different kinds
            of text.
          </p>
          <p>
            For testing purposes, we can load the seven fonts, fill some boxes
            with sample text in Arabic and Persian, and set up a selector to
            compare the appearance of that text from one font to another. We
            ought to have a sense of what our alternatives might be, so the
            samples will initially be displayed in a browser/system default font
            (“serif”; this would be the worst case). There is a further option
            to try the “<a
              href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/reboot/#native-font-stack"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >native stack</a
            >” used in Bootstrap. (My guess is that other popular CSS frameworks
            take similar approaches.) I’ll follow up below with my conclusions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why am I doing this, by the way? Apart from wanting to identify
            fonts suitable for use in my work, I think that improvement in the
            general condition of Arabic-script typography on the web (as well as
            on our devices) will require knowledgeable users to give a damn. The
            current <em>status quo</em> is unrecognizably better than what I saw
            ten or fifteen years ago, but there’s still work to be done.

            <strong>Tl;dr:</strong> None of these fonts is bad. (The less
            desirable ones were excluded already.) Some did better than others.
            I would say that Lateef, Markazi Text, Mirza, and Scheherazade
            basically passed all of the tests. (<strong>Update:</strong> See
            below for discussion of odd behavior in Markazi Text.) While I have
            comments on each of those four, they passed. Amiri is stylistically
            superior, but it has frustrating problems with diacritic placement.
            Aref Ruqaa can’t overcome the limitations of a handwriting
            font&#8202;—&#8202;though I don’t fault the designer. It’s nice for
            what it is. Tajawal is surprisingly delightful, but it shits the bed
            whenever a Persian letter occurs. (Come on; this would be so easy to
            fix!) After years in the top spot, Scheherazade is still probably my
            favorite. But Markazi Text is, on a technical level, the most
            impressive Arabic-script web font that I’ve encountered. Assuming
            you like the style, you could use it just about anywhere.
          </p>
          <p>Now let’s comment on the candidates one at a time…</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Amiri:</strong> This is, of course, a beautiful typeface,
            and I have a lot of respect for the developers behind the project.
            It’s an
            <a
              href="https://github.com/alif-type/amiri"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >open-source</a
            >
            and (if I’m not mistaken) ongoing effort. What I like most about
            Amiri is the versatility that it has by virtue of its timeless
            design. As for the version available through Google
            Fonts&#8202;—&#8202;last updated in April 2020&#8202;—&#8202;there
            are a few rough edges. The biggest problem is in the placement of
            diacritics. They seem to be set at the same height relative to the
            <em>line</em>, regardless of the <em>letter</em> to which they’re
            attached. In effect, the designers have made sure that all
            diacritics go high or low enough not to collide with any letter
            forms. This leads to two problems. First, it looks odd when a
            diacritic is floating in space, far from the associated letter.
            (See, for example, the final hemistich in our snippet of Persian
            poetry.) Second, and perhaps more seriously, diacritics can bump
            into text in the previous or (less often) the subsequent line. One
            kind of collision has been avoided at the cost of another. There are
            ways of dealing with this. The letter forms could be made smaller
            overall, relative to line height, in order to leave more empty
            vertical space. (With Scheherazade and Lateef, this approach is
            taken to an extreme.) In more modern Arabic type designs, you’ll
            usually see that the variation in letter height is reduced; namely,
            tall letters like <em>alif</em> and <em>lām</em> don’t extend too
            much higher than the short letters. This makes life easier. It
            probably isn’t an option for Amiri, given the historical
            inspiration, but who knows&#8202;—&#8202;just a touch of vertical
            compression might make a difference. What would seem to be the key
            optimization, however, would be to get diacritics closer to the
            letters. (See Markazi Text for a good example of this.)

            <strong>Aref Ruqaa:</strong> What can I say? I found this typeface
            æsthetically pleasing when I first saw it, and I still do. It proved
            somewhat more resilient than I expected. But at the end of the day,
            this is a kind of

            font, and there are going to be places where its logic is outfoxed
            and it produces strange, unnatural orthography. The worst problems
            occur where certain letters (<em>sīn</em> and <em>shīn</em> are big
            offenders) are found in long connected segments. These strings of
            letters are set to start from above and slope downward, ending at
            line level. It can be a nice effect, and reminiscent of real
            handwriting, when just a few letters are involved. But certain
            combinations lead to bizarre results. (See, for example, the third
            verse of four in the passage from the Qur’an.) If you’ve ever tried
            a <em>nasta‘līq</em> typeface, this issue will be familiar to you.
            Anyway, I’m sure that Aref Ruqaa has its place, and I’d like to see
            further development in Arabic-script handwriting fonts.

            <strong>Lateef:</strong> This is an old standby

              >from SIL</a
            >. I always viewed it as the similar but slightly inferior cousin of
            Scheherazade. (See also my comments on the latter.) The stroke is
            heavier. My understanding is that it doesn’t have as many glyphs.
            (What’s with the empty circle in place of the standard marker for
            the end of a qur’anic verse?) You know, Lateef is fine; I just don’t
            use it.

            <strong>Markazi Text:</strong> This is a newer font&#8202;—&#8202;a
            <a
              href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/typography/variable-fonts"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >variable font</a
            >, at that!&#8202;—&#8202;from Borna Izadpanah. I could say a lot
            about it, but I’ll limit myself here to four points. First, Markazi
            Text is well designed. It does everything you could reasonably ask
            of it, and then some. Second, make sure that you set the HTML
            <code>lang</code> attribute to <code>"ar"</code> wherever you use
            this font. Otherwise you might encounter problems with diacritics.
            (In particular, I saw that adding a <em>shaddah</em> plus a short
            vowel to a letter&#8202;—&#8202;not an uncommon
            scenario&#8202;—&#8202;resulted in a
            <a href="img/markazi-broken.png">break in continuity</a>.) Markazi
            Text is the only font I tested that has such sensitivity to the
            <code>lang</code> attribute, and I don’t know why. (<strong
              >Update:</strong
            >
            Even with correct settings, I see weird behavior involving
            diacritics in Safari. Now I worry there’s something amiss with the
            font.) Third, the style may not be for everyone. I think it’s a bit
            unpleasant how the final tooth of <em>sīn</em> or
            <em>shīn</em> reverses the slant so decisively (and only in the
            initial or medial position?). But artists have license, no one is
            forcing me to use this, I should make my own font if I’m so bothered
            by it, yada yada. Fourth… actually, I can’t remember what my last
            point was supposed to be. Maybe it’ll come back to me. The bottom
            line is that Markazi Text is a good general-purpose typeface.
            Setting aside the finicky behavior around combined diacritics, it
            holds no bad surprises that I’ve seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mirza:</strong> I like this font well enough. The
            proportions are correct, and it has some nice ligatures. It’s worth
            noting that those ligatures appear in Chrome and Firefox, but not in
            Safari. So the distinctiveness of the typeface will be lessened for
            users of iOS devices. This is puzzling to me, since Amiri includes
            some of the same ligatures, and it’s more consistent across all
            three browsers. (<strong>Update:</strong> This seems to have been
            fixed. I don’t know if the problem was with Safari or Mirza, but
            it’s gone now.) Anyway, Mirza has other stylistic idiosyncracies
            that should be taken into consideration. I’m not a big fan of the
            stubby comma. Diacritic placement is handled in an interesting way.
            They’re set close to the letters, and they’re so <em>small</em>!
            Shrinking the diacritics is one way of preventing collisions. I
            think they could be a bit difficult to make out. On an esoteric
            note, the common practice in Arabic script, when a
            <em>kasrah</em> and a <em>shaddah</em> are added to the same letter,
            is to move the <em>kasrah</em> above the letter (directly below the
            <em>shaddah</em>). Mirza instead leaves the <em>kasrah</em> beneath
            the letter regardless of context. I hesitate to call this wrong, but
            it’s unusual. (<strong>Update:</strong> I later noticed that Markazi
            Text displays the same behavior.) It’s possible I’ll use this
            typeface at some point. It didn’t break in any of the tests.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scheherazade:</strong> This has been my Arabic-script font
            of choice for years, both on and off the web. It isn’t perfect, but
            it’s close, and I keep returning to it. One thing to be aware of is
            that Scheherazade always comes out looking smaller, with more space
            between lines of text, relative to other typefaces at the same
            “size.” (This also applies to Lateef.) The generous built-in spacing
            allows the font to maintain traditional proportions and accommodate
            diacritics without many problems. Now, I don’t always need this
            buffer. Sometimes I find myself both increasing the size and
            decreasing the line height/spacing where I use Scheherazade. But I
            like that it errs on the side of safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tajawal:</strong> Somehow I find this appealing! The style
            is quite modern&#8202;—&#8202;far from the
            <em>naskh</em> derivatives that I generally prefer. I don’t think I
            could go through with using this for longer blocks of text. It looks
            cool, though, and it handles diacritics surprisingly well. The
            biggest problem here is the lack of support for Persian letters.
            Even the Persian <em>yā’</em> (<code>U+06CC</code>)
            <a href="img/tajawal-broken.png">breaks</a> this font, which is
            unnecessary, since it should be identical to the Arabic
            <em>yā’</em> in the initial or medial position, and identical to the
            Arabic <em>alif maqṣūrah</em> in the final or isolated position. So
            the glyphs already exist. To include <em>pe</em>, <em>che</em>, and
            <em>zhe</em> would mean adding dots; <em>kāf</em> and
            <em>gāf</em> would require a bit more effort. The situation doesn’t
            need to be as bad as it is currently.
          </p>
          <p>Now for a few final notes…</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Divine ligatures:</strong> Two of the most
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet#Ligatures"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >characteristic ligatures</a
            >
            in Arabic are for Allāh and <em>lillāh</em> (the latter meaning
            “unto God”). Many fonts, in many text
            processors&#8202;—&#8202;including modern
            browsers&#8202;—&#8202;will automatically produce the Allāh ligature
            if the letters <em>alif</em>, <em>lām</em>, <em>lām</em>,
            <em>hā’</em> appear followed by a space. A smaller number of fonts
            go a step further, generating a ligature for <em>lillāh</em> as
            well. (The only difference in spelling between the two words is the
            initial <em>alif</em> in Allāh. The ligatures also tend to be
            identical except for the separate first letter, in which case
            applying the <em>lillāh</em> ligature is as good as applying both.)
            And some fonts have neither. I try not to get too fussed about this,
            since there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach, but
            we may as well test it. As can be seen above, among our seven fonts,
            Amiri is the only one that makes both ligatures automatically.
            Markazi Text and Tajawal modify Allāh, but not <em>lillāh</em>.
            (This is currently my preference.) The others&#8202;—&#8202;Aref
            Ruqaa, Lateef, Mirza, and Scheherazade&#8202;—&#8202;produce neither
            ligature. It’s not a hill worth dying on.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Browser differences:</strong> I checked everything in
            current macOS versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. In Chrome,
            the default “serif” font performs
            <a href="img/default-fonts.png">unusually badly</a> when diacritics
            are introduced. YMMV. (<strong>Update:</strong> This seems to have
            been fixed. It’s nice to revisit these points, just a year later,
            and see little improvements!) Once I switch to any of the dedicated
            Arabic-script fonts in Chrome, it’s smooth sailing. Firefox is even
            better. Not only do the Google Fonts work properly, but Firefox
            provides a nice default typeface that looks almost like a derivative
            of Scheherazade with added ligatures (and less-than-ideal diacritic
            placement). Kudos to whoever set that up! Safari is perhaps the
            weakest performer. It doesn’t act up too badly with the default
            font, but I saw problems with diacritic use in both
            <a href="img/aref-ruqaa-safari.png">Aref Ruqaa</a> and Markazi Text.
            And there are disabled (?) ligatures in Mirza. (<strong
              >Update:</strong
            >
            All of these issues seem to have been fixed, at least to some
            extent.) What I can say, in any case, is that relying on a fallback
            font for Arabic or Persian is risky.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bootstrap fonts:</strong> Honestly, I’ve found that a
            well-thought-out “native stack” appears to be a workable option for
            Arabic-script languages. It may not be beautiful, but it won’t be
            broken, either. The Bootstrap default setting has not turned out
            badly in any browser, on any device that I’ve tested. Is this
            burying the lede? Is there any point in loading a web font? For me,
            the answer is still yes; I want something a bit nicer. But for a
            project where the goal is to support Arabic and Persian text,
            without prioritizing it, I don’t think this would be called for. As
            we all know, the practice of relying on widely available native
            fonts has clear advantages.
